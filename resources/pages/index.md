A technologist designing and delivering solutions for humans with data.

I'm a data and technology consultant at [whiletrue](https://whiletrue.industries), working with companies and non-profit organizations on designing and building software systems.

Previously, I was CEO at [Datopian](https://datopian.com), supporting governments, enterprise, and non-profits with products and services for data management.

Before that, I was CTO/CPO at [Open Knowledge International](https://okfn.org), a global non-profit that works with government, business and civil society on open data and open knowledge projects towards data-driven social change.

I've worked for the last 14 years designing and building user interfaces, scalable web servers, AI-driven chatbots, and platforms for data management and analysis. I've taken such projects from idea to production on my own, and leading teams of 2 - 30 people.

I love to write and contribute to [open source software](https://github.com/pwalsh), and I curate and co-author a range of [specifications for data interoperability](https://frictionlessdata.io).
